## Problems

#### Next Permutation 
[[LeetCode]](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation)
[[Code]](https://github.com/markstock7/smash-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/scala/algorithms/array/NextPermutation.scala#L11)

Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).

The replacement must be in-place and use only constant extra memory.

Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.

```
1,  2,  3 → 1,  3,  2
3,  2,  1 → 1,  2,  3
1,  1,  5 → 1,  5,  1
```

#### Majority Element 
[[LeetCode]](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)
[[Code]](https://github.com/markstock7/smash-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/scala/algorithms/array/MajorityElement.scala#L4)

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

Example 1:

```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

Example 2:
```
Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```
