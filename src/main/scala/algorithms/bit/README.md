## Problems

#### Sum of Two Integers 
[[LeetCode]](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)
[[Code]](https://github.com/markstock7/smash-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/scala/algorithms/bit/SumOfTwoIntegers.scala#L4)

Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example 1:

```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1
```

#### Single Element in a Sorted Array
[[LeetCode]](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/)
[[Code]](https://github.com/markstock7/smash-algorithms/blob/master/src/main/scala/algorithms/bit/SingleElementInASortedArray.scala#L4)

Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears twice except for one element which appears once. Find this single element that appears only once.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
```
Note: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.
