## Problems

#### [Subtree of Another Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/)

Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. 
A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. 
The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

**Examples**

```
Given tree s:                Given tree t:

     3                             4
    / \                           / \
   4   5                         1   2
  / \
 1   2
```

```
Given tree s:               Given tree t:
     3                             4
    / \                           / \ 
   4   5                         1   2
  / \
 1   2
    /
   0
```
